                You are the leader of the Second Home Project. 
                Your goal is to terraform mars and make it a second home for humanity.
                Your rocket landed on Mar's north pole. 
                You have brought 6 founding colonists, some food and water, as well as a year's (earth year) worth of oxygen with you.
                In the first two days, the colonists set up power, a shelter and a rover. 
                The Second Home Project is off to a great start, but food and water won't last forever...
                <br><br>
                Task:<br>
                Figure out how to make food

            <label>
                Even though you have the seeds, you don't have the soil, and martain soil takes a lot of time to proccess...<br>
                But no need to worry! An adult human can survive for up to 1 month without food, and we should have some food ready before then, 
                but there is still one problem; The colonists need meet along with plants in thier diets, and meat is a primary source of protien 
                and iron which the colonists need.
                <br><br>
                Task:<br>
                Get meat into the colonist's diets.

                The rocket will arrive in 6 months.<br>
                Your colonists sent the rover to do some exploring and it soon finds a very odd-looking rock.
                <br><br>

            <label>
                Your 2 scientists don't have the propper tools to fully examine the sample so you store it somewhere safe.<br>
                They will send it to earth when the rocket arrives for propper examination.

                Several days pass on Mars until it is day 25. The soil proccessing is complete! 
                In a few day the newly-planted seeds should be ready for harvest. Just then, a meteor strikes right next to the base camp!
